# About the Club

[Liner notes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liner_notes) are the printed text and graphical content often added to the packaging of musical recordings. Sometimes they contain little more than the list of songs and the people involved with recording them. Other times they contain fantastic inside looks at the recording process for an album, the song lyrics, critical reviews of the recording, mixed media explorations of the music's themes and content, and more.

[Liner Notes Club](https://linernotes.club) is a Mastodon instance dedicated to providing fans of music with a place to socialize and share their love of making and listening to music.

If you are looking for a Mastodon instance without a strong local theme, we recommend exploring other options using the tools at [https://instances.social/](https://instances.social/).

# Code of Conduct

Music is universal. Music unites across all cultural, linguistic, and ideological differences; [we are one nation under a groove](https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2019/11/new-harvard-study-establishes-music-is-universal/). What moves you? What gets your body twitching, your head nodding, your jaw hanging open in disbelief? What inspires you to create? We created the Club to celebrate the joy of experiencing music in whatever form your experience takes.

Whoever you are, wherever you are, if you love music, you are welcome here. Please help us ensure that *everyone* is welcome, by following these guidelines. This is not an exhaustive list of what we can and cannot do on linernotes.club. Take it in the spirit in which it is intended -- a guide to make it easier for everyone to participate in this community.

This code of conduct applies to all users of the Club, including its administrators and moderators. Violation of this Code may result in suspension from the Club. Additionally, violation of this code outside the Club may result in user suspensions, instance silencing or blocking (defederation).

## 1. General Guidelines

- **Be welcoming**. We strive to be a community that welcomes people of all backgrounds and identities. This includes, but is not limited to members of any race, ethnicity, culture, national origin, colour, immigration status, social and economic class, educational level, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, age, size, family status, religion, neurodiversity, and physical ability.
- **Be respectful**. Not all of us will agree all the time, but disagreement is no excuse for poor behavior and poor manners. We might all experience some frustration now and then, but we cannot allow that frustration to turn into a personal attack. Members of the Club should be respectful of each other and of other users in the Fediverse.
- **Choose your words with care.** Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down others or belittle their experiences.
- **Make it easy for others to moderate their experience**. Liberally use Content Warnings, hashtags, and unlisted/"Followers Only" posts so others can choose whether to engage with your content.
- **De-escalate**. In general, if someone asks you to stop, then stop. Avoid microaggressions such as "not all men," white/man/cis-splaining, knowingly using the wrong pronouns to address someone, posting about particular individuals without naming them ("subtooting"), and so on. If you make a mistake, apologize.
- **No Gate-Keeping**. We love all kinds of music in the Club, including much that you may not love. Accept and celebrate that *we* love it.
- **Be friendly**. Don't be a dick.

- The majority of your toots are on-topic

Bots are permitted under the following requirements:

- Bots must be pre-approved by the Club Moderation Team

## 3.3 External Use

### 3.3.1 Crawling, Indexing, and Archiving

Crawling https://linernotes.club to gather information about posts, post metadata, media, or other content hosted on the Club is prohibited for any purpose, including but not limited to analysis, creating databases, search indexes, or archives.

### 3.3.2 Federation

Federating with the Club is not guaranteed. Links between federated instances are temporary and may change or disappear at any time. The Administrators of the Club and their delegates determine which instances the Club will federate with and which are silenced, blocked, or suspended.

# 4. Copyright

Public toots are derived works that are protected by copyright.

All original content is copyrighted by the author and cannot be distributed or used without prior permission by the author. Do not repost or disseminate our users' original content anywhere without their express permission.

# 5. Moderation

The Club's administrators and their delegates will summarily and with prejudice suspend or terminate users who violate the Club's Terms of Service, and silence or block (defederate from) instances enabling those users. You may comport yourself however you wish; we are not required to provide you a platform to do so.

If you believe someone is violating Code of Conduct, we ask that you submit a report when you block the user or instance. Provide as much detail as is necessary for the Club's Moderation Team to have the context required to fully investigate the issue.

If you are reporting a user on an instance other than Liner Notes Club, please be sure to forward the report to the user's instance also.

## 5.1 Our Responsibilities

The Administrators and Moderation Team will endeavour to:

- Lead by example, abiding by the Terms of Use.
- Keep the atmosphere of the Club as welcoming and enjoyable as possible.
- Keep the Club online and functional for as long as possible.
- Clarify the standards of acceptable behaviour.
- Enforcing the Terms of Use with appropriate corrective actions when users are found to be in violation.

We will not act on complaints regarding:

- Good-faith criticism such as "This is sexist," "That comes off as tone deaf," "This comment offends me," and so on. Instead of reporting this kind of feedback, engage with it, apologize, or agree to disagree and move on.
- Swearing or profanity. Use filters or mute/block users whose language you don't enjoy.
- Reasonable communication of boundaries, such as "leave me alone," "go away," or "Iâ€™m not discussing this with you".

## 5.2 Corrective Actions

The following are some examples of corrective actions the Moderation Team may enact in specific situations. **These are examples only and meant to illustrate our general approach to moderation**. Each incident of reported unacceptable behaviour will be handled on its own merits.

**If you are a Club member and violate our Terms of Use**, we will: 

- suspend your account;
- inform you via email of the suspension and the reasons for it; and
- explain what you need to do to be reinstated, such as apologize to affected parties or agree not to continue posting *Prohibited Content*.

**If you are a user of a federated instance and harass one of our members**, we will:

- suspend your account; and
- inform your instance's Moderation Team.

**If another instance fails to actively moderate the posting of *Prohibited Content* via weak moderation**, we will:

- silence the instance

**If another instance explicitly or implicitly enables the posting of *Prohibited Content* or enables harassment, trolling, doxxing, and so on**, we will:

- block (defederate from) the instance

## 5.3 Accountability

### 5.3.1 Moderation Decisions

Moderated servers -- that is, instances that are silenced or blocked by us -- will be posted to https://linernotes.club/about.

Changes to the moderated servers list will be posted using the #LinerNotesAdmin hashtag by one of the Moderation Team.

### 5.3.2 Appeals

If you believe the Moderation Team has made an error in judgement or the corrective action(s) we have taken are inappropriate, please contact us. The Moderation Team acts in good faith and strives to always act fairly, but we will make mistakes and when we do we will embrace those mistakes and learn from them.

In the event of a dispute, the Administrators may override the Moderation Team; their judgment is final.

### 5.3.3 Requests for Clarification

If you require clarification of these Terms of Use, or are unsure how to handle a potential violation of these Terms, please message the Moderation Team directly on Mastodon.

### 5.3.4 Changes to the Terms of Use

The Administrators and Moderation Team will occasionally update these Terms of Use as necessary. Minor updates such as edits for clarity or changes in Moderation Team membership will be posted using the #LinerNotesAdmin hashtag by one of the Administators. Significant changes to policy, such as changes to the Code of Conduct, will be drafted and made available for review and feedback by Club users for at least 5 days.
