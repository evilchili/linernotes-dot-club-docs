- The majority of your toots are on-topic
- Off-topic toots are a combination of Unlisted/"Followers-Only", marked with a Content Warning, and/or tagged with an appropriate hashtag so folks can easily ignore, mute, or filter them.

Crawling https://linernotes.club to gather information about posts, post metadata, media, or other content hosted on the Club is prohibited for any purpose, including but not limited to analysis, creating databases, search indexes, or archives.

### 2.3.2 Federation

Federating with the Club is not guaranteed. Links between federated instances are temporary and may change or disappear at any time. The Administrators of the Club and their delegates determine which instances the Club will federate with and which are silenced, blocked, or suspended.

# 3. Copyright

Public toots are derived works that are protected by copyright.

All original content is copyrighted by the artist and cannot be distributed or used without prior permission by the artist. Do not repost or disseminate our artist's original content anywhere without their express permission.

# 4. Moderation

If you believe someone is violating the Club's Terms of Use, including its Code of Conduct and the Server Rules, please contact the Club's moderation team.

## 4.1 User Suspensions

We have a zero-tolerance policy for violations of our Terms of Use including the Code of Conduct and the Server Rules and will aggressively suspend users who willfully violate them.

## 4.2 Arbitration 

The moderation team is responsible for enforcing the Terms of Use and will investigate and resolve reports of violations of the Terms of Use (see section 4.1), but are not responsible for regulating people's behaviour or resolving personal disputes.

Users who cannot moderate their own behaviour, their own safety, or resolve disputes amongst themselves, may be suspended, at the sole discretion of the moderation team.

## 4.3 Blocks, Suspensions, and Defederation

We strongly believe that the Fediverse works best when users exercise their own agency. Accordingly, we prefer individual actions such as users muting or blocking other users and instances over instance-level policy changes such as defederation.

However, the Club's administrators and their delegates will summarily and with prejudice 
silence, suspend or defederate from instances whose users regularly violate our Code of Conduct.You may comport yourself however you wish; we are not required to provide you a platform to do so.
