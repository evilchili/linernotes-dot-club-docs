# About the Club

[Liner notes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liner_notes) are the printed text and graphical content often added to the packaging of musical recordings. Sometimes they contain little more than the list of songs and the people involved with recording them. Other times they contain fantastic inside looks at the recording process for an album, the song lyrics, critical reviews of the recording, mixed media explorations of the music's themes and content, and more.

[Liner Notes Club](https://linernotes.club) is a Mastodon instance dedicated to providing fans of recorded music with a place to socialize and share their love of making and listening to recorded music.

If you are looking for a Mastodon instance without a strong local theme, we recommend exploring other options using the tools at [https://instances.social/](https://instances.social/).

# Code of Conduct

Music is universal. Music unites across all cultural, linguistic, and ideological differences; [we are one nation under a groove](https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2019/11/new-harvard-study-establishes-music-is-universal/). What moves you? What gets your body twitching, your head nodding, your jaw hanging open in disbelief? What inspires you to create? We created the Club to celebrate the joy of experiencing music in whatever form your experience takes.

Whoever you are, wherever you are, if you love music, you are welcome here. Please help us ensure that *everyone* is welcome, by following these guidelines. This is not an exhaustive list of what we can and cannot do on linernotes.club. Take it in the spirit in which it is intended -- a guide to make it easier for everyone to participate in this community.

This code of conduct applies to all users of the Club, including its administrators and moderators. Violation of this code may result in suspension from the Club. Additionally, violation of this code outside the Club may affect a person's ability to interact with the Club and its users.

## Guidleines

- **Be welcoming**. We strive to be a community that welcomes people of all backgrounds and identities. This includes, but is not limited to members of any race, ethnicity, culture, national origin, colour, immigration status, social and economic class, educational level, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, age, size, family status, religion, neurodiversity, and physical ability.
- **Be respectful**. Not all of us will agree all the time, but disagreement is no excuse for poor behavior and poor manners. We might all experience some frustration now and then, but we cannot allow that frustration to turn into a personal attack. Members of the Club should be respectful of each other and of other users in the Fediverse.
- **Choose your words with care.** Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down others or belittle their experiences.
- **Make it easy for others to moderate their experience**. Liberally use Content Warnings, hashtags, and unlisted/"Followers Only" posts so others can choose whether to engage with your content.
- **De-escalate**. In general, if someone asks you to stop, then stop. Avoid microaggressions such as "not all men," white/man/cis-splaining, knowingly using the wrong pronouns to address someone, posting about particular individuals without naming them ("subtooting"), and so on. If you make a mistake, apologize.
- **No Gate-Keeping**. We love all kinds of music in the Club, including much that you may not love. Accept and celebrate that *we* love it.
- **Be friendly**. Don't be a dick.
